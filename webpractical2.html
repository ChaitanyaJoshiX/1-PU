    The CMR National PU College ITPL was founded in 2014 with an inaugural class of 133 students.
    The college is known for a focussed approach that uses first-class methodologies to help our students reach greater heights.
    Students are also taken on field trips to industries, which exposes them to the corporate culture and they get a first hand account of a work environment.
    Few colleges can boast of the student teacher ratio that we have which is one of the many reasons why this relatively young college has risen to such prominence.
